Sub-Sites
---------

The site is divided into a number of sub-sites, associated with the
top-level directories, and these are mostly presented in a distinct
fashion as though each was a whole site.

This is what blogs typically call "categories", more or less, so
when looking for code samples or whatever, look for "categories".

HBlog Sub-Site Main Page
------------------------

Sub-Sites have URLs like http://rlpblog.digitalkingdom.org/career/foo.html

A: Hand-built list of articles of especial interest
B: Administrivia stuff
C: Contact / About should be the page that links back to the
uber-site, so we can warn people  :)

Article page is the same except article title

Article list page (i.e. where you get from the tag cloud) is the
same except titles and first paragraphs and some metadata

Uber-site is the same except both main text and sidebar links are
links to the sub-sites

Tag Cloud
---------

For a sub-site, the tag cloud is selected of only "[sub-site]:foo"
tags, and the "[sub-site]:" is stripped.  For the uber-site, the
"[sub-site]:" tags are ignored and the others are presented.

Tags
----
- TODO: Sub-directories within a sub-site automatically become tags;
  might have a massage table for them to make them less jargon-y,
  but maybe not
- Every page gets tags with both the sub-site version and the
  plain version, as well as every combo.  So a page in the
  "computing" sub-site with "tags: programming, sysadminning" will
  internally generate:
  - programming
  - sysadminning
  - programming+sysadminning
  - computing:programming
  - computing:sysadminning
  - computing:programming+sysadminning
- When you're in a sub-site, all the non-"[site]:" tags are
ignored for all purposes
