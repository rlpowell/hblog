<p>Since I got back into Lisp again (I had a wonderful flirtation with it in University, but it was presented as a toy language, so I didn’t stick with it), I’ve been telling people how incredibly freeing it is, and how I seem to be allergic to syntax. I’ve had a hard time explaining this to other people, and finally hit on a way to do it. This essay is the result.</p>
<p>Before I get into this, some general comments on Lisp:</p>
<p>If you’re saying “Eww, how can you count all those parens?”, You’re Doing It Wrong(external link). See scheme-style(external link) for how it actually works. Note that this objection is different from “I don’t like all those parens”, which is a perfectly legitimate personal choice, but see the rest of this essay. If you’re saying “But Lisp is a toy language”, you’re simply incorrect(external link).</p>
<p>Unless you want to make one of those two points, please feel free to email me about this essay.</p>
<p>Moving on. I use an example out of Perl. It doesn’t actually matter what the example means, I don’t think, except that it’s setting a sub-set of a complex data structure hanging off the object “self”.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have:</p>
<p>$self-&gt;{‘CONF’}-&gt;{‘outerdatawindow’} = $outerdatawindow;</p>
<p>I have no idea how this would work in CLOS(external link) off the top of my head, but let’s say it looks like this in CL:</p>
<p>(setf (outerdatawindow (CONF self)) outerdatawindow)</p>
<p>In both cases, I need to know:</p>
