<ul>
<li>hyper competent wizard solves problems, but she is a tiny old Chinese woman who bases her success on underestimation. maybe she fronts as someone’s sidekick or housekeeper</li>
<li>I’d like to reverse the usual last of his kind trope, like someone is the last of his kind but then he goes out and fixes it, like that is hit quest: to actually solve the fucking problem instead of give up the way everybody seems to.</li>
<li>(not in my usual mode) someone is running a pawn shop with the goal of sort of being a real-life super hero: trying to actually solve the underlying problems in the lives of eir clients</li>
<li>what modifications to humans would be required to make http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Kata actually possible? What side effects would such modifications, and the ability to make them, have on the culture in question?</li>
<li>So in the original mythology Hercules (Herakles) is a very stupid, sick, murderous motherfucker that somehow ends up looking good to the greeks in the end. What I want is a story that assumes that there was a historical personage there, and tells the story of this super-strong insane motherfucker … and the smart little friend of his who follows him around and spins all the fuckups. Because that’s the only way I can see how the Herakles legends look the way they do, and I totally wanna meet his sidekick. “Uhhh…. Well, as I already told you, he’s a child of Zeus, and we know how jeaulous Hera, gets. Yeah, that’s it, Hera made him do it! Yeah…”</li>
</ul>
