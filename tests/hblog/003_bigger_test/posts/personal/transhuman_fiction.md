title: 'Post-Singularity And Transhumanist Fiction I''ve Enjoyed'
---

Everything here has some relation to superintelligence, transhumanism,
or ((My Views On The Future|the singularity)). Note that when I say "the
singularity", I'm referring to the advent of super-human intelligence.

Everything here is something I've enjoyed. Each story has a synopsis. I
try, but not very hard, to avoid spoilers.

Much of it is available online.

In approximate order of how much I liked it.

If you'd like to suggest an addition, please
\[mailto:rlpowell@digitalkingdom.org|send me an email\].

-   Basically everything by
    \[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal\_Asher|Neal Asher\]. In terms of
    raw enjoyment, he's my favorite author right now (Dec 2010). The
    Polity series is about the adventures of various, mostly
    hypercompetent, beings (mostly human) in a universe where the
    godlike AIs have decided to let humanity do for themselves in a lot
    of ways, and all the crazy hypertech is mostly deadly dangerous.
-   Everything I've read so far by
    \[http://www.peterfhamilton.co.uk/|Peter F Hamilton\]. I've read The
    Night's Dawn and Commonwealth Saga serieses, and they were
    completely fantastic. In particular, Hamilton is by far the best
    author I've ever read at spinning out many many separate plot
    threads, and then weaving them all back together in the end. I just
    wish he'd include a glossary of people and places; that would
    increase my enjoyment of his books ''considerably''.
-   The
    \[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Golden\_Age\_(novel\_series)|Golden
    Age series\] by
    \[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John\_C.*Wright*(author)|John C.
    Wright\] is special to me becuase of its value as propoganda: it is
    the only post-singularity fiction I've read that (ignoring the
    problems the main character has) (1) is a
    \[http://dotsub.com/view/96f08002-1f65-45d1-ba97-a8cc05784d94|Nice
    Place To Live\]
    (\[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the\_fun\_theory\_sequence/|here's the
    written form\]) and (2) the immortal people with no real problems
    are doing interesting and (to them) meaningful things, not just
    lying around blissed out. I've found at least one case in which
    someone I had extensively explained singularity related stuff and
    how awesome the future might be didn't really get it until he read
    these books, at which point it all made sense to him.
    \[http://lesswrong.com/lw/k9/the\_logical\_fallacy\_of\_generalization\_from/|Generalizing
    from fictional evidence may be bad\], but it's a pretty handy way to
    paint a clear picture in the mind of your listener.
-   \[http://sifter.org/\~simon/AfterLife/|After Life\] by
    \[http://sifter.org/\~simon/|Simon Funk\] follows the story of the
    first upload (who is also one of the scientists that invents
    uploading), and the society that results from it.
-   \[http://localroger.com/|The Passages Series\] by
    \[http://localroger.com/|Roger Williams\] (yes, those are the
    same link) is something I've not actually read the entirety of. In
    fact, I've only read "Passages In The Void" and "The Passage Home".
    It's fantastic. It's about AI spaceships that save humanity by
    placing them around interstellar brown dwarfs, stars being too
    unpredictable, and a group that really wants to see earth anyway, no
    matter how dangerous it is.
-   \[http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/index.html|The Metamorphosis
    of Prime Intellect\], also by
    \[http://localroger.com/|Roger Williams\]. Note that besides the
    general warning there about sex and violence, the final chapter has
    incest with someone who is (by American standards, anyways) a minor.
    It is largely consensual (the adult protests somewhat). That sort of
    thing seems to really upset some people, so you might want to skip
    most or all of the final chapter; people seem to think it's fine
    without it anyways. This is about an AI that is based on
    \[http://www.asimovlaws.com/|Asimov's Three Laws\] and discovers a
    hole in physics that gives it basically unlimited powers to stop
    humanity from ever doing anything that might hurt them.
-   \[http://www.kschroeder.com/my-books/lady-of-mazes|Lady Of Mazes\]
    by \[http://www.kschroeder.com/|Karl Schroeder\] explores a concept
    that I find particularily fascinating: given sufficient
    intelligence, it might be possible to engage in extremely subtle
    manipulations of very complex systems such that the results would be
    a new, more complicated system that the super-intelligence
    understands and controls but that are totally mysterious to humans.
    Lady Of Mazes is basically entirely about that; the difficulty of
    communication with the super-intelligences follows from it, and of
    course The Book is exactly an example of that concept. \*\*
    \[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Fire\_Upon\_the\_Deep|A Fire Upon
    The Deep\] by \[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor\_Vinge|Vernor
    Vinge\], which I wholeheartedly reccomond, touches on this concept
    as well: the Skroderiders response to the Blight, for one, and the
    formation of the Blight itself for another. \*\*
    \[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando\_(novel)|Accelerando\] by
    \[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/|Charles Stross\] also uses this
    concept, when Aineko talks about exploiting the halting states in
    the human mind. On a related note, I once heard Stross talk about
    how to write superintelligences, and he gave an illustrative
    example, paraphrased: "When I need to take my cat to the vet, I
    bring out the cat carrier. The cat knows what this means, and then
    runs for the cat door. He is then ''very'' surprised to discover
    that it's closed and locked. To him, these two events are
    totally coincedental. I think that it's easy to write a story about
    a superintelligence: just have any humans that try to act against it
    constantly surprised by apparent coincidences that turn out to all
    have been the superintelligence's fault in the end."
-   \[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaper/Mechanist\_universe|The
    Shaper/Mechanist Stories\] by
    \[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce\_Sterling|Bruce Sterling\] is,
    for me, basically technologically heavy teenage male power
    fantasy porn. That's probably just me, though; there's a lot of very
    thoughtful stuff in here, like discussions about the necessity of
    intelligence for a technologically advance species. It also does a
    really fantastic job of showing how relatively normal people could
    become progressively more and more transhuman. But when you get
    right down to it, I love this series because my inner 16 year old
    wants to be the Lobster King.
-   \[http://ttapress.com/553/crystal-nights-by-greg-egan/|Crystal
    Nights\] by \[http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/|Greg Egan\]
    is about a man who creates a computer powerful enough to simulate a
    world and develop intelligent beings within it, so they can help him
    achieve the singularity. Or so he hopes.
-   \[http://www.fictionwise.com/servlet/mw?a=v&t=book.htm&bi=86|Fossil
    Games\] by \[http://www.philart.net/tompurdom/|Tom Purdom\]; there's
    a \[http://www.philart.net/tompurdom/fossil.htm|bit of the
    intro online\]. Basically two threads: what happens when humanity
    gets heavily into mental enhancement?, and what happens when a
    spaceship managed by (something like) Slashdot finds aliens?

-   I enjoyed \[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beggars\_in\_Spain|Beggars
    In Spain\] well enough, but it describes a very light progression in
    intelligence/capability, and I found the political aspects just kind
    of weird. I simply had trouble seeing what her (the author's)
    point was.
-   I'm going to partially ''dis''reccomend the Revelation Space series
    by \[http://voxish.tripod.com/|Alistair Reynolds\]; I like heroism,
    and I like the good guys to win in the end. In those rare cases
    where I enjoy really dark fiction, it's in short story form; I can't
    take very much of it. This series felt to me like a constant slog
    through awful things happening to people, and I kept expecting it to
    resolve positively, and it never did, which upset me quite a bit.
    Having said that, if you like that sort of thing you'll like this.
    It's full of ''fantastically'' creative SF ideas, no doubt about it.

Stuff I Should Read:

-   The rest of \[http://localroger.com/|The Passages Series\]
-   \[http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/3ju/looking\_for\_some\_pieces\_of\_transhumanist\_fiction/|People
    have now asserted\] that Banks' "The Player Of Games" and
    "Excession" are safe (the latter was re-affirmed by someone who
    emailed me privately).
-   From a random emailer: You omitted Richard Morgan ("Altered Carbon",
    etc), Wil McCarthy (invention of faster than light replicators - a
    long series) and especially, Alaister Reynold (all novels incredibly
    good - space opera at its best).

A long aside:

Those amongst you who are familiar with these genres will notice the
glaring lack of any \[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain\_Banks|Ian
Banks\], an omission so severe that I feel the need to apologize for it.
I have read exactly one book by Banks,
\[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consider\_Phlebas|Consider Phlebas\]. It
is one of the few books I genuinely regret having read. He seemed to
have a love affair with trying to gross me out, and he succeeded
admirably. There was nothing sufficiently excellent in there to make up
for the horror of The Eaters. In fact, I can remember almost nothing
else about the book. Apparently this is just me, because the WP article
doesn't even mention that section at all. I keep asking people to
reccomend Banks that they are sure ''does not'' include such deliberate
attempts to disgust the reader, but so for no-one has been willing to
make such an assertion.

I've gotten a lot of comments about the above, so let me expand a bit.
The issue there may be totally idiosyncratic. It may be specifically
about ''food''; I made the ''utter'' error of reading
\[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1004045|The Jeweller Of Second
Hand Roe\] recently, which is the only thing that I have ever read, that
I can recall, that actually caused me nausea. It was all about food.

I am normally quite difficult to gross out; torture doesn't bother me in
the slightest (I enjoy
\[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Sword\_of\_Truth|Goodkind\], for
example), nor does any form of explicit sex. Since I had been grossed
out so thoroughly be the bits in question, I therefore concluded that
Banks must have gone far out of his way to be really disgusting.
Feedback I have since received leads me to belivee that, rather, I was
unusually sensitive to it; so far no-one else has mentioned it as having
stood out as particularily gross to them. So I'm trying to own this as
my own issue at this point.

Having said all that, I would have been OK with it had the segments in
question done ''anything'' to advance the plot. It was the total
gratuitousness that really set my teeth on edge.
