I had pretty mixed feelings about this book, but I'm very happy I
read it; there was seriously worthwhile stuff in here that I hadn't
known before.

The basic thesis appears to boil down to "full-scale market
economies treat labour, land, and money as though they were normal
commodities that can be bought and sold freely, created and
destroyed, etc; this leads to absolutely *horrible* outcomes unless
restrained".  The idea of a complete market economy in which
everyone benefits was described as "utopian", and successfully
demonstrated as such; I now firmly believe that you cannot have an
unrestrained market economy that doesn't destroy social order,
lives, and the environment, and I was not entirely convinced of
these things before.

On the flip side, the author did a piss-poor job of coming up with
ways the amazing power of market economies can be harnessed without
the negative side effects; see [Cons](Cons).

Pros:
* The fact that market economies did not exist until a couple of
  hundred years ago, and that in particular Middle Ages and
  Renaissance Europe *was not* in any sense a market economy no
  matter how much modern authors talk about the importance of
  wandering traders, was startling and fascinating.
* The examples of historical non-market economies (i.e. middle ages
  Europe) were often fascinating.  The shredding of the myth of the
  barter-oriented primitive human was very good.  I had *no idea*
  that moving between towns was basically totally forbidden in
  the middle ages; you worked the family plot of land that your
  ancestors had worked, period.
  * Con: It felt like there might be some cherry-picking of
    examples; I'm pretty certain that the ancient Greeks did a lot
    of market-oriented stuff, but they were never mentioned.
* The 

Cons:

* The writing is *terrible*.  I'm very averse to academic-style
  "never use a short word when mellifluous verbiage will do"
  writing, but even for that this book seemed exceptionally bad at
  getting its point across. That is: I had to work much harder to
  extract the author's point than I should have.
* The writing assumes a pretty decent economic background,
  sometimes.  Sometimes basic points are lingered on, and sometimes
  the other will say something that I'm sure is totally obvious to
  economics students 
* failure to offer alternatives
* The author didn't appear to notice that all of the examples of
  historical non-market economies came with aspects that modern
  readers would find totally intolerable, in particular *extreme*
  restrictions on travel, whether de facto (primitive tribespeople)
  or de jure (middle ages farmers).
  * The author did not, in fact
