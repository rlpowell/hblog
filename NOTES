DESIGN-SITE is what we're aiming for the site to look like.

DESIGN-CODE is the design of the code itself.

When ready, move both *into* the blog itself, and make them
symlinks.

Inline docs syntax: https://www.haskell.org/haddock/doc/html/ch03s02.html

Should probably install https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc
globally, and use that for all markdown.

TODO
----

- make at least two categories + main site
  - categories don't currently have anything like an index page
  - main site is now called "meta"; make its index suck less
- add redirects to all the tiki imports
- tag pages are not sub-blogged; for example, /tags/computing.html
  shows up with the main site's color bar
- support both per-category and global archives, which may mean
  pushing the archive's URL to default.html, as I'm not sure what
  /$categoryText$/archive.html will do on the global site
- include the pictures in Drawing Butterflies With K
- move css/ , index.html , etc into assets/ ?
  - Not sure about that, but index.html seems silly; have
    posts/[site]/index.md with whatever verbiage ; left sidebar
    favorites is posts/[site]/faves.md
- At least some header bits need to be category specific; <title>
maybe?, or should that just be the article name?
- Make the category banner work via posts/[category]/header.html (or
  .md, but .html seems maybe better for this purpose)
- make per-category CSS that adds like a background color or
  something to everything on that site; presumably this can be
  loaded via posts/[category]/header.html
- put the number of posts per item in the tag cloud in parens, like
  "programming+psychology (6)"
- make the cat:tag pseudo-tags show up when on the main site
- if any tags have more than 1 entry, stop showing the tags that
  have only 1
- make "Posted in: " not show up in the rendering if there's no
  tags; also maybe rename that to "Tags: " or something
- make script to run the generation, send upset email if it doesn't
  work, and push the results into our webspace
- Nice-to-have: generate a history page for each page that does
  colored diff markup
- issues found in the_great_transformation:
  - "posted in" is terrible; it should only list the tags defined on
  the post individually
  - the metadata at the top doesn't stand out from the body at all
  ; needs bolding of things like "Last Updated On", spacing from the
  body, maybe even a line
- give TikiWiki to Pandoc
